Another title worth adding to your tech policy reading list. The authors survey a broad swath of tech policy territory — privacy, search, encryption, free speech, copyright, spectrum policy — and provide the reader with a history and technology primer on each topic.

Written in 2008, it is a bit dated but that's not a problem. Nice companion/parallel to the Hello World book. This one is free.
